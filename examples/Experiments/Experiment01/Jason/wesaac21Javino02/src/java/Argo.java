/**
 * Base agent architecture class that defines the overall agent architecture;
 * the AS interpreter is the reasoner (a kind of mind) within this architecture
 * (a kind of body).
 * 
 * <p>
 * The agent reasoning cycle (implemented in TransitionSystem class) calls these
 * methods to get perception, action, and communication.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This class implements a Chain of Responsibilities design pattern. Each member
 * of the chain is a subclass of AgArch. The last arch in the chain is the
 * infrastructure tier (Centralised, JADE, Saci, ...). The getUserAgArch method
 * returns the first arch in the chain.
 * 
 * Users can customise the architecture by overriding some methods of this
 * class.
